    This program works the same as the cat program installed in linux. When running the program with no argumetns, the program will take input from standard input and write it to standard output. If the argimets are files, the program will read the content of the files and send it to standard output.

    The files:
    DESIGN.PDF: outlines the design of the dog program
    Makefile: used to compile the source file of dog program
    dog.c: source file for dog program
    WRITEUP.pdf: the write up for the assigmnet dog
